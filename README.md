# Steam Deck and Legion Go S - Installing Clover Script for Dual Boot Between SteamOS (or Bazzite) and Windows (and other OSes too!)

## About

A collection of tools that is packaged into an easy to use script that is streamlined and tested to work with the Steam Deck and Lenovo Legion Go S running on SteamOS.

* The main program that does all the heavy lifting is [Clover - a graphical boot manager / boot loader.](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader)
* Clover Toolbox is a shell script that offers a simple GUI to configure some aspects of Clover script.
* Custom systemd script that performs a sanity check whenever SteamOS starts up making sure that the dual boot is intact and repairs it automatically if needed.

</p>

## Quick Install Steps - if you are in a hurry then this is what you need (but really you should read the rest of the README!)
Perform some Windows config first! Boot to Windows and open elevated command prompt -
1. ```cmd
   bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} highestmode on
   ```
2. ```cmd
   reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation" /v RealTimeIsUniversal /d 1 /t REG_DWORD /f
   ```

Once done, boot to SteamOS to install Clover!
1. Boot into SteamOS, then go into Desktop Mode and open a konsole terminal.<br>
2. Clone the github repo. <br>
   ```cmd
   cd ~/
   ```
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot
   ```
   
   If it errors that folder already exists, delete the old folder first - <br>
   ```cmd
   rm -rf ~/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot
   ```
   
   Then perform the clone again - <br>
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot
   ```
   
3. Execute the script! <br>
   ```cmd
   cd ~/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot
   ```
   ```cmd
   chmod +x install-Clover.sh
   ```
   ```cmd
   ./install-Clover.sh
   ```
   
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/043d8e7c-9d57-48b2-a1ad-f93c94cf3e9f)

4. The script will check if sudo passwword is already set. <br>
    - If it is already set, enter the current sudo password and the script will continue.
    - If wrong password is provided the script will exit immdediately. Re-run the script and enter the correct sudo password!
    - If the sudo password is blank / not yet set by the end user, the script will prompt to setup the sudo password. Re-run the script to continue.
    - Script will continue to run and perform sanity checks all throughout the install process.
                     
5. Reboot the Steam Deck. Clover is installed and you should see a GUI to select which OS to boot from! Use the DPAD and press A to confirm your choice. You can also use the trackpad to control the mouse pointer and use the RIGHT SHOULDER BUTTON for LEFT-CLICK.<br>

<b>6. OPTIONAL - Scheduled Task for Windows. Use this only if you have Windows installed on microSD / external SSD and if Windows keeps hijacking the bootloader!</b>

4. The script will automatically create the C:\1Clover-tools folder and copy the files in there. <br>
5. It will also automatically create the Scheduled Task called CloverTask-donotdelete. <br>

10. Close Task Scheduler. Go to C:\1Clover-tools and look for the file called status.txt.<br>
11. Open status.txt and the Clover GUID should be the same as the bootsequence. Sample below.<br>

## Why Use this Clover install script for dual boot?!?
1. Makes as little changes as possible to the SteamOS / Windows installation.
2. Makes dual boot with SteamOS / Windows easy with a nice GUI.
3. No extra config needed for Ventoy, Batocera, Kali, Ubuntu and Fedora. (if there are other OS you want to be added just let me know)
4. Automatically and easily re-create the dual boot entries if it gets broken by a BIOS / SteamOS / Windows update. No need to type manual commands!
5. Supports random themes (Mojave and Catalina bundled in the install script), add / remove themes, icons, background using Dolphin File Manager.

## How to Add / Remove Themes
<details>
<summary><b>Read this first - ESP partition size</b></summary>
The esp partition is only 64MB in size. This is where SteamOS, Windows and Clover EFI entries are saved.<br>
The free space on the esp partition is around ~25MB. Make sure the themes you download don't exceed this size!<br>
You can have multiple themes installed and Clover will automatically pick a random theme on every reboot!<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Read this first - custom icons</b></summary>
When adding your own theme, make sure to name your custom SteamOS and Batocera icons as follows - <br>
os_steamos.icns<br>
os_batocera.icns<br>
This are just regular PNG files, but you have to rename them to have the icns file extension.<br>
Sample icons are saved in custom\iconset folder. Thanks to WindowsOnDeck reddit members u/ch3vr0n5 and u/ChewyYui !!!<br>

<summary><b>Steps to Add / Delete Themes</b></summary>
1. Boot into Desktop Mode and then open Dolphin File Manager.<br>
2. Navigate to /esp on the lower left side. It will say "Could not enter folder /esp"<br>

3. Right-click and select "Open as Root."<br>

5. A new folder will appear for the esp partition.<br>
   Take note of the free space located in the lower right side. On this example the free space is around 26MB.<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98122529/215268989-56a661dc-e2c5-40fb-b57e-9b49a4de93a7.png)<br>

6. Visit the [Clover Themes github](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverThemes) to download the themes. Make sure the themes you download doesn't exceed the free space of the esp partition from step5.<br>

7. Navigate to efi > clover > themes. It will show a list of themes installed. By default it will show 3 - random, Catalina and Mojave.<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98122529/214928509-7d6cae5e-107e-4bcd-baa7-2051f6ddb269.png)<br>

8. **Don't delete the random folder!** It is needed so that when there are multiple themes installed, Clover will randomly pick a theme on every reboot.<br>
9. Delete the themes you don't want and copy / paste new themes that you have downloaded.<br>
10. Reboot and enjoy the new theme!<br>

## Known issues
### Issues with external display with resolution higher than 1080p
If Steam Deck is connected to an external display with a resolution **higher than 1080p** (1440p, 4K, etc.), there are some issues that Clover may cause.
* Clover screen **will be rotated**. See images below for examples. Once an OS is started, the screen should show in the correct orientation.
* Windows **may show BSoD** or otherwise **fail to boot**. See these issues for the reference: [#43](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot/issues/43), [#85](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot/issues/85)

| Resolution | Clover screen |
|-|-|
| 1080p | ![Clover on 1080p display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98122529/230472962-0c981a47-2677-4766-80ad-c2b27d7f62c7.png) |
| 4K | ![Clover on 4K display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98122529/230472728-b73bc18f-563d-4149-9d18-27792d6031b7.png) |

Because of these issues, when using an external display, it is recommended to use a display with 1080p or lower resolution.

If you use a display with a resolution higher than 1080p anyway, a workaround for these issues is available to make Windows boot normally and make Clover screen show in the correct orientation only on the external display.
1. Open Clover Toolbox.
1. Select "Resolution".
1. Change the resolution option to "DeckSight".

Note that this workaround **will make Clover screen rotated on Steam Deck's built-in display** when it is not connected to an external display.
