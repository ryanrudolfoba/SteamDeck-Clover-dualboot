# Steam Deck - Installing Clover for Dual Boot Between SteamOS and Windows


## About

This repository contains the instructions and scripts on how to install [Clover - a graphical boot manager.](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader)

This will mostly benefit Steam Deck users who have setup a dual boot and wants to have a graphical way to select which OS to boot from.
> **NOTE**\
> If you are going to use this script for a video tutorial, PLEASE reference on your video where you got the script! This will make the support process easier!

> **NOTE2**\
> If anyone is good at graphics editing, please take a look at the [Clover themes here.](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverThemes)
> \
> Please pick several themes, edit the icons / backgrounds etc etc and let me know a download link.\
> I can integrate that so the theme is tailor fitted for the SteamOS / Steam Deck. Thank you!

## But Why Use Another Boot Manager?!? What's Different?!?
> **NOTE1**\
> This is a continuation of my rEFInd script from [here.](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-rEFInd-dualboot)\
> The design goal is the same from my rEFInd implementation - make as little changes as possible to the system.

> **For the SteamOS side**\
> The script copies files to the /esp/efi/clover location and manipulates the EFI boot orders. No files are renamed / moved.\
> Extra scripts are saved in ~/1Clover-tools which manipulates the EFI boot orders, and an uninstall to reverse any changes made.\
> There are no extra systemd scripts created, ~~no extra power shell scripts needed~~ and no need for EasyUEFI.

> **For the Windows side**\
> The script creates a folder called C:\1Clover-tools and creates a Scheduled Task.\
> The Scheduled Task runs the powershell script saved in C:\1Clover-tools. The powershell script queries the EFI entries and sets Clover to be the next boot entry.

> **NOTE2**\
> If the EFI boot entries are missing due to BIOS updates or due to official SteamOS updates, just manually reboot into SteamOS and it will fix the dual boot automatically. No need to type any commands!

> **NOTE3**\
> The config.plist for Clover is 1100+ lines! The config I have bundled here does the basic function - present SteamOS and Windows (on the internal SSD) for dual boot.\
> It is encouraged to please review the config.plist, make changes as needed for improvement and contribute back.

1. **NEW** - Use a different boot manager - Clover.
2. **NEW** - Does not rename / move Windows EFI entries.
3. **NEW** - When the dual boot breaks, just boot back manually to SteamOS and it will fix the dual boot entries on its own!
4. Does not rely on 3rd party systemd scripts / ~~powershell scripts~~ / EasyUEFI.
5. All-in-One script - install, disable / re-enable, uninstall!
6. Doesn't rely on pacman repositories - uses the latest (as of this writing V5151) Clover ISO from [here.](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases/download/5151/Clover-5151-X64.iso.7z)


## !!! WARNING - WARNING - WARNING !!!
> **WARNING!**\
> Please carefully read the items below!
1. The script has been thoroughly tested on a fresh SteamOS and Windows install.
2. If your SteamOS has prior traces of rEFInd or scripts / systemd services related to rEFInd, it is suggested to uninstall / remove those first before proceeding. If you were using my rEFInd script then it's all good as I don't use systemd services.
3. If your Windows install has scripts or programs related to rEFInd / EasyUEFI, it is suggested to uninstall / remove those first before proceeding.

I don't know what the behavior will be if those are present in the system. Remove them first before using this script!

## Prerequisites for SteamOS and Windows
**Prerequisites for SteamOS**
1. No prior traces of rEFInd or scripts / systemd services related to rEFInd.
2. sudo password should already be set by the end user. If sudo password is not yet set, the script will ask to set it up.

**Prerequisites for Windows**
> **NOTE**\
> This applies to Windows installed on the internal SSD / external SSD / microSD.
1. No scripts / scheduled tasks related to rEFInd or EasyUEFI.
2. APU / GPU drivers has been installed and screen orientation set to Landscape.
3. This is VERY IMPORTANT! Do not skip this step! 
    * Open command prompt with admin privileges and enter the command -\
        ``bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} highestmode on``
    * If this complains about 'The Parameter is incorrect' see Q1 in the FAQ below for the command for your system.
        
## Using the Script
> **NOTE1 - please read carefully below**
> 1. Make sure you fully read and understand the disclaimer, warnings and prerequisites!
> 2. The script will create a directory called ~/1Clover-tools with scripts to enable / disable Windows EFI and an uninstall to reverse any changes made. Do not delete this folder!

> **NOTE2**\
> The design goal is the same from my rEFInd implementation - make as little changes as possible to the system.

> **For the SteamOS side**\
> The script copies files to the /esp/efi/clover location and manipulates the EFI boot orders. No files are renamed / moved.\
> Extra scripts are saved in ~/1Clover-tools which manipulates the EFI boot orders, and an uninstall to reverse any changes made.\
> There are no extra systemd scripts created, ~~no extra power shell scripts needed~~ and no need for EasyUEFI.

> **For the Windows side**\
> The script creates a folder called C:\1Clover-tools and creates a Scheduled Task.\
> The Scheduled Task runs the powershell script saved in C:\1Clover-tools. The powershell script queries the EFI entries and sets Clover to be the next boot entry.

> **NOTE3**\
> The installation is divided into 2 parts - 1 for SteamOS, and 1 for Windows.\
> The recommended way is to do the steps on SteamOS first, and then do the steps for Windows.


**Installation Steps for SteamOS**

1. Go into Desktop Mode.
2. Open a konsole terminal.
3. Clone the github repo. \
   ``cd ~/`` \
   ``git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot``
   
3. Execute the script! \
   ``cd ~/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot`` \
   ``chmod +x install-Clover.sh`` \
   ``./install-Clover.sh``

4. The script will check if sudo passwword is already set.\
   **4a.**
         If it is already set, enter the current sudo password and the script will continue.\
         If wrong password is provided the script will exit immdediately. Re-run the script and enter the correct sudo password!

   **4b.**
         If the sudo password is blank / not yet set by the end user, the script will prompt to setup the sudo password. Re-run the script to continue.
         ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98122529/211833223-f7a096e5-9ae3-4481-8ad1-569e6f21adb0.png)
